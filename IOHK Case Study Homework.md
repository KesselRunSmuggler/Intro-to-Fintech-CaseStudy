# **IOHK - A Case Study**

## Overview and Origin of IOHK

Input Output, also reffered to as Input Output Global and more commonly known as Input Output Hong Kong, was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. In 2013, after leaving a consulting job to form the Bitcoin Education Project, Hoskinson joined the founding team of Ethereum; a now successful blockchain network.

After disagreements between Hoskinson and other founding members of Ethereum regarding the structure of the project, Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014. Whilst Hoskinson wanted to accept venture capital and create a formal governing structure, others wanted to keep Ethereum an op-source, non-profit organisation. 

A few months later, Hoskinson was approached by former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood to form IOHK. Their plan was to form an engineering company that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains for governments, corporations and educational institutions. 

Luckily, being early adopters in the cryptocurrency space already, the two were able to fund the start of the project themselves. When the price of Bitcoin really began to rise in the following years, they liquidated some of their holdings and now claim they have enough capital to run for decades. The current market cap at time of writing is $74 Billion USD, with a fully diluted valuation of $104 Billion USD.

## Business Activities:

The financial problem that IOHK is trying to solve is a big and rather bold one. They plan to provide citizens in developing nations who have no access to official documentation, services, education, credit or credibility, with a digital identity. They hope to be able to, as they say, "bank the unbanked", a notion that will provide individuals with sovereignty and control over their identity, property, their education and credentials, get insurance and be able to apply for credit. With these details stored on IOHK's blockchain network (Cardano) this information is permanant, tamperproof, distributed and secure. In April 2021, IOHK and the government of Ethiopia announced they would be partnering to create a blockchain-based system that would track 5 million school students' progress in local schools.

Roughly half of the world's population is unbanked, and those who are but live under oppressive regimes can have their accounts frozen and all rights removed. On the 15th August, 2021, an ultraconservative political and religious group took control of the Afghani capital, Kabul. Many residents had only hours to collect what they could and flee. These people then need to be processed and their identities verified on arrival in other countries. Having data stored in a way that is easily accessible and immutable in situations like this would allow streamlined processes in times of crisis. Although many of these nations lack much of the infrastructure that we utilise in the west, many of these citizens are internet enabled through mobile phones, giving them access to the network. 

Although still in it's development phase, what makes Cardano different from other networks is it's scaling capability. It uses what's known as proof-of-stake, rather than the earlier technology of proof-of-work used by Ethereum. This allows a person participating in the network to be rewarded for their contribution based on the how much of the Cardano cryptocurrency, ADA, they hold (and stake) instead of the amount of computing power they can contribute. The participant is then rewarded for this with more ADA. This means Cardano isn't limited by the infrastructure, energy use and slow transaction times which have burdened older projects that have scaled massively since their inception. Hoskinson understood these implications after working on Ethereum, and developed Cardano and its primary cryptocurrency in 2017. 

Throughout the development roadmap of Cardano (and its consensus protocol, Ouroboros) it goes through phases (or eras) of development that incorporate peer-reviewed insights from evidence-based methods in order to achieve milestones and ensure smooth and successful rollout. Once fully released, the platform aims to be a decentralised digital application (DApp) development platform with verifiable smart contracts and a multi-asset ledger.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts which contain terms of agreement between two parties written into lines of code. This information is stored across a blockchain, meaning that it exists in a distributed, decentralized, transparent and immutable way. This allows transactions and agreements between anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system or external enforcement; if the required terms aren't met and verified by participants in the network (called nodes), the contract or transaction isn't executed. 

## Landscape:

As well as the cryptocurrency and blockchain space more broadly, IOHK and it's Cardano platform plan to disrupt and innovate multiple financial domains, including banking, lending and global remittance, as well as less directly financial but still relevant areas including voting and governance, education, health and identity. The overall, positive economic outcomes from this disruption cannot be ignored. 

### Major Trend Changes and Innovations Over the Last 5-10 Years

#### *Cryptocurrency and Blockchain:*

The proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism is currently leading the way in consensus algorithm technology. As mentioned earlier, it solves the scaling problems and transaction costs of the original consensus algorithm, proof-of-work. The earlier technology uses more and more computing power to verify and execute transactions, as more transactions take place. This verification is what "mines" early cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, as it's distributed as a reward for participation. The problem is the amount of energy needed is almost always increasing, and is a cost that miners must take on. The source of this energy consumption can't be ignored either, as depending on the source, the process can be blamed for contributing to excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Although, this is more about the power source of the grid, rather than the mining process itself.

PoS seeks to mitigate this by accrediting mining power based on the percentage of available tokens held by the miner, rather than the amount of computing power they provide. 

Another advantage of PoS over PoW is that it's less vulnerable to network attack. As a coin on PoW would get more and more expensive to mine, the number of miners participating would decline. This means eventually a miner or group of miners could control 51% of the computational power of the network and create fraudulent transactions in favour of themselves, whilst invalidating the transactions of others. PoS solves this, as a miner or mining pool would need to hold 51% of all available coins to do the same thing. Over 70% of available ADA is currently staked by various individuals and pools to verify transactions for reward. Therefore not enough ADA is available for purchase on exchanges (a marketplace for cryptocurrencies) for this kind of attack to take place. 

#### *Banking*
Banking itself still relies on the old formula of lending and protecting deposited funds. Traditionally a bricks-and-mortar institution, the whole banking sector has seen wide development over the decades including the use of ATMs, plastic bank cards and credit cards. More recent developments include internet and mobile banking and contactless payments. Even more recent disruption would include the introduction of cryptocurrencies and digital wallets like Square; holding globally recognised and transactable funds not issued by a central government. It is predicted that the Fintech space will continue to disrupt the traditional banking in areas such as lending which has already seen the beginnings of vast change. 

#### *Lending*
Innovation in the lending domain has seen the rise of buy now, pay later companies such as Zip and Afterpay, as well as microlending and crowd-funding, for example GoFundMe. These spaces have opened up opportunity (and risk) for those individuals and startups who need either small amounts for a single purchase, or larger capital in order to start a project or expand their business. Often large, traditional financial institutions insist on particular requirements being met in order for a person or startup to receive funding. These requirements can hinder progress and expansion for those who don't meet them. An example could be a farmer in a remote, third world country who knows he could farm far more efficiently if he could afford to upgrade to machinery. If he was part of the network, he could get a crypto-loan on the Cardano blockchain. Crypto-loans allow trust less peer-to-peer lending, also known as Decentralised Finance or Centralised Finance, depending on the provider. 

* **Centralised Finance** works like a traditional bank by having a third-party hold a lenders assets and conduct transactions between them and the borrower. The borrowing pays back the amount borrowed, based on the terms, with interest, and the lender receives interest for their participation. 

* **Decentralised Finance** allows lenders and borrowers to participate in these transactions using smart contracts, and without having to provide identification or needing a third-party to hold your assets. Therefore, it is available to everyone. 
The lender sends their assets to a smart contract protocol and begins to receive redeemable tokens that represent what they lent, plus interest. The borrower must provide collateral to the smart contract protocol in order to borrow other tokens. The amount borrowed depends on the amount available thats provided by lenders, and the amount of collateral provided by the borrower. The amount of borrowed funds must stay below the amount of collateral. If the amount of collateral falls below the amount required, then the capital is liquidated. 

#### *Global Remittance*

Global remittance is the money or goods sent home by migrants to their home countries. In many low-middle income countries, individuals head to more affluent countries for work in order to support their families back home and promoting economic activity. The World Bank estimates that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, officially recorded remittances hit $719 billion, with $548 billion going to low-middle income countries. Remittances exceed 10% of GPD in countries like Guatemala, Senegal and the Philippines.

The average cost of these transfers is the problem. The process incurs charges from intermediaries at both ends of the transfer. Globally, transfers using cash and bank accounts cost 7% of the amount sent in fees.
with the development of mobile transfers, the cost has reduced to an average of 4.2%. 

Cardano's transaction fee is determined by the cost including the data of the transaction added to permanent record in the blockchain, which fluctuates with market supply and demand. The average fee is about 0.16-0.17 ADA, which at the time of writing is about $.035USD. 

## Results and Recommendations

Still technically in it's infancy and although smart contract capability is planned to roll-out in mid September 2021, the amount of projects that are being developed on the network is growing. 

IOHK's goal of improving the lives of billions of people is leaps and bounds above other businesses in the blockchain domain. They are hitting their milestones with precision after years of peer-reviewed research and development. 

The implementation of the IOHK's Cardano blockchain will be able to impact innumerable businesses and individuals, only limited by their imagination. Their level of success will be measured by the lives they change.
